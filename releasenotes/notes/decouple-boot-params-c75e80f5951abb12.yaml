    Adds a new ``set_system_boot_options`` method to the ``System`` object
    superseding the ``set_system_boot_source`` method. The new method has
    all boot parameters optional to allow for more atomicity when PATCH'ing
    Redfish ``Boot`` object. The new method will only include those items in
    the PATCH document, that are explicitly passed by the user. This change
    might improve interoperability with BMCs that do not handle certain
    attributes of the ``Boot`` object.
